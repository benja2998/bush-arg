# bush

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dylanaraps/bush.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dylanaraps/bush)

This is an experiment to see how many standard tools and functions we can re-implement in pure bash. No external processes are used, only shell builtins. Bush is not meant to be used for anything serious and there's probably edge cases and bugs throughout.

Feel free to hack around with this, that's the entire point anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

See the [package](https://github.com/Kali-in-Batch/pkg/tree/main/packages/bush-arg) for the latest updates and information.
